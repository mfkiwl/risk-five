addStripe will allow jog to connect padcore ring and block ring.
Stripes will stop at the boundary of the specified area.
When breaking rings, the power planner will consider the existence of blocks.
Stripes will not extend to closest target.
The power planner will set stripe antenna targets to none (no trimming allowed).
Stripes will not be created over regions without power planning wires.
