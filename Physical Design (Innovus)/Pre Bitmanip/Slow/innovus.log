**WARN: (IMPEXT-3530):	The process node is not set. Use the command setDesignMode -process <process node> prior to extraction for maximum accuracy and optimal automatic threshold setting.

PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design core.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
